There are already a lot of posts on the internet discussing how you can set up your Raspberry Pi and connect it with your printer (with CUPS), like How to add a printer to your raspberry pi or other Linux Computer. So this is not the main focus of this post. The focus of this post is on how to extract a PPD file from the original printer driver package provided by the manufacturer, which is needed by the Linux system (and of course, Raspberry Pi), when CUPS doesn’t have native support on it. Specifically, I am using my Lenovo M7605D as an example.
