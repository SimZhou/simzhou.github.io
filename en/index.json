Especially in the area of programming, you can have almost unlimited things to learn (frontend, backend, machine learning, different languages, etc). Even if when you’re doing a single project you might still find yourself diving into different knowledges and documentations and end up very confused. This is sometimes good but not always necessary because you might not need to know every single detail when you only want to apply something. My browser tabs while learning/working on sth.

You might have new perspectives after relaxing yourself for a while. This point is actually consistent to stop setting too many unachievable goals cause if you can lower your expectation to yourself, you will relax.
