Normally if your computer case is advanced enough, it would prepare you anti-vibration nail rubbers to remove the noise from HDD. However as an old computer which don‚Äôt have the condition, what can we do?

Having nearly the whole HDD plastered with rubber bands makes it not only less noise conducted but also safer (in case if I wanna move the computer here and there sometime).
